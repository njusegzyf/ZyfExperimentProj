    // The members of an intersection type A & B are all the members of A and all the members of B.
    // For instance Resettable & Growable[String] has member methods reset and add.
    // & is commutative: A & B is the same type as B & A.

    // If a member appears in both A and B, its type in A & B is the intersection of its type in A and its type in B.
    // For instance, assume the definitions:
    sealed trait A:
      def children: List[A]

    sealed trait B:
      def children: List[B]

    final class C extends A, B:
      def children: List[A & B] = ???

      def children: List[A & B] = ???

    val x2: A & B = new D()
    
    // The type of children in A & B is the intersection of childrenâ€™s type in A and its type in B, which is List[A] & List[B].
    // This can be further simplified to List[A & B] because List is covariant.
    val ys: List[A & B] = x2.children

    // One might wonder how the compiler could come up with a definition for children of type List[A & B] since what is given are children definitions of type List[A] and List[B].
    // The answer is the compiler does not need to. A & B is just a type that represents a set of requirements for values of the type.
    // At the point where a value is constructed, one must make sure that all inherited members are correctly defined.
    // So if one defines a class C that inherits A and B, one needs to give at that point a definition of a children method with the required type.
